			<h1> Challenge </h1>
			<p> In this lab, my partner and I learned to pseudocode. We first learned how pseudocoding works by using the method to describe how to make a sandwich. Then, we thought of a simply task that a computer could do. For our project we decided to pseudocode a basic program that would have a user fill in a Mad Lib.</p>

			<h2> Problems </h2>
			<p> By working together, my partner and I faced few problems. The hardest part of this lab was coming up with a task that was simple to pseudocode. We didn't want to get too lost in the details, so we tried to think of only the biggest steps in our program. Other than that, though, we managed to complete this lab easily. </p>

			<h3> Results </h3>
			<p> First, my partner and I pseudocoded a basic task- making a sandwich: </p>
			<p id="list"> -Gather ingredients<br>
			-Bread, meat, cheese, veggies, and sauce<br>
			-Lay out two bread slices<br>
			-Put sauce on both bread slices<br>
			-Layer meat, cheese, and veggies on one of the bread slices<br>
			-Put bread slice on top of the meat, cheese, and veggies<br>
			-Cut sandwich<br>
			-Eat sandwich<br> <p>
			<p> Next, we psuedocoded a basic computer task- creating a madlib.
			<p id="list"> -Set up story template with empty variables representing ‘blanks’ <br>
				-Have the user input words for the madlib <br>
				-Computer would ask for diff word types (verb, noun, ect) <br>
				-Assign user input to the empty variables <br>
				-Print final story with variables replaced with user input words <br>
			</p>
			<p>We then formatted it into code comments: </p>
			<p id="list">
			//Set up story template with empty variables representing ‘blanks’<br>
			//Loop through variables in a list<br>
				//Have the user input words for the madlib<br>
				//Assign user input to the empty variables<br>
			//Print final story with variables’ data replaced with user input words<br>  </p>
		</div>
